        <h1>EVOLVING BOIDS</h1>
        <h2>An investivation of natural selection.</h2>

          <h3>"Why are living things so complex?"</h3>
          <p>Living things exhibit many complex behaviors, on a spectrum ranging from behaviors that seem instinctual,
              to those that seem intelligent. Scientific evidence suggests that these behaviors arise from Darwinian
              evolution. Evolution refers to the change of a species of living thing (dogs, cats, elephants, elm trees,
              yeast) over time. The mechanism for this change is <i>natural selection</i>.</p>

          <h3>Natural Selection</h3>
          <p>Living things on earth are complex products of their ancestors, their contemporaries, and their environments,
              so it would be incorrect to ascribe the appearance or behavior of any living thing to any one mechanism. However,
              biologists have identified that the development and maintenance of all living things on earth is controlled
              by a molecule called DNA.
          <p>The DNA of every organism consists of a unique sequence of base pairs, containing instructions that are read by the
              organism's cells. This unique sequence of base pairs is called a <i>genome</i>. This genome determines many of the
              characteristics of the organism: a collection of separate <i>traits</i> which all together are called the organism's
              <i>phenotype</i>. When living things reproduce, they pass their genotype on to their offspring. If the reproduction
              is sexual, then their genotype is passed on in combination with the other parent, creating a blend of the two genotypes.
              In either form of reproduction, the new offspring genotype is also subject to <i>mutation</i>, which makes small,
              random changes to the new genotype. This new genotype will produce a new phenotype in the offspring, similar but not
              identical to its parent(s).
          </p>
          <p>A living thing's phenotype largely determines the way it interacts with its environment, including whether it 
              will live long enough to reproduce. Statistically, organisms that are more likely to reproduce will contribute
              more offspring to the population than others--and remember that these offspring inherit their parent's genotype!
              So, if an organism has a trait that makes it more able to reproduce, its genotype, which encodes that trait, appears
              in a greater number of the collective offspring than other, less successful traits. This idea is really important;
              in fact, it's the central idea of natural selection. It's common to use the word <i>fitness</i> to describe this concept,
              meaning the likeliness of an individual to have more offspring than its peers, as determined by that individual's traits.
              
              To recap, the core observation of natural selection is as follows:
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>The fitness of living things is determined by their genotype and their environment. Fitter organisms have genotypes that
                produce phenotypes with certain advantageous traits, and as a result they have more offspring. These offspring
                share their parent's genotype, causing the proportion of organisms with that genotype to increase.</i>

        <h3>The Blind Watchmaker</h3>
        <p>In order for natural selection to work, the environment must put living things under some kind of pressure, such that
            some traits lead to survival and reproduction more often than others. In addition, the living things need to reproduce
            in some way such that traits are inherited. When those two conditions are met, fitter traits will spread in a population
            of living things, while other traits will not. If the environment, which decides what "fitness" is, doesn't change that
            much, the result of natural selection over time is to increase the average fitness of living things. Biologists all agree
            that natural selection created every variety of living thing that has existed.
        </p>
        <p>
          This claim may seem unbelievable: there is so much diversity, complexity, absurdity, and beauty in the natural world! 
          Natural selection is like a blind watchmaker, assembling beautiful creatures that can grow hundreds of feet tall, live
          at the bottom of the ocean, or communicate over hundreds of miles. And yet, nobody has been able to show that natural
          selection could have produced all the living things that we see. In physics, theories can be clearly put to the test:
          either a set of axioms explains and predicts events, or it does not. But natural selection cannot be tested in the same
          way. To play back evolution on earth using natural selection, we would need to know in detail all of the environments,
          all of the populations of living things, and all of the chance encounters! In short, it is at the present time impossible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet, natural selection doesn't have to be taken on faith. There are many compelling arguments (similarity of all life forms
          on earth, the fossil record, molecular genetics), but a fun one is creating a little environment, and little living things,
          so that we can observe natural selection at work.
